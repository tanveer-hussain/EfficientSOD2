### 1. Paper Links
ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06788

CVPRW: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022W/FaDE-TCV/papers/Hussain_Pyramidal_Attention_for_Saliency_Detection_CVPRW_2022_paper.pdf

## 2. Setup
You need to install Pytorch (preferred 1.7.1) and some basic libraries including PIL, cv2, numpy, etc.

## 3. How to Train?

### 3.1. Datasets
The datasets can be downloaded from the following links. We follow the training and testing data similar to the previous methods.

Option 1: Download from Google drive of an existing SOD Method ([UCNet](https://github.com/JingZhang617/UCNet)): [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zslnkJaD_8h3UjxonBz0ESEZ2eguR_Zi/view)

Option 2: Download from GitHub of existing SOD Method (D3Net): [Click here](https://github.com/DengPingFan/D3NetBenchmark/blob/master/README.md)

Option 3: Follow a dedicated GitHub page for SOD datasets: [Click here](https://github.com/GrassBro/SODdataset)

### 3.2. Training and Testing
Run train.py (current training code supports RGB-D dataset training, you can request for RGB as well or tune the code yourself)

In the training code, there is function call to the testing code which then evaluates the model's performance and stores the results in corresponding folders.
